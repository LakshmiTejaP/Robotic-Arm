# Robotic-Arm
The aim of our research paper is to represent our project which can be used to pick and place things in desired positions.Now days in this fast growing industrial age every company needs speed in manufacturing to cope up with the customerâ€™s requirements. The basic objective of our project is to develop a versatile and low cost robotic arm which can be utilized in any industry or work place to eliminate this problem. Our robotic arm can be used in number of application by changing the program of controller and the structure is designed in such a way that it is capable to lift light loads but can also lift medium loads. Our robotic arm using arduino works efficiently in good power supply to pick objects.
